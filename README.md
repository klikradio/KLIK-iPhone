#KLIK-iPhone

## Overview

KLIK Radio is an Internet radio station.  This is our iPhone app.  We open-sourced it in the hopes that volunteers, both locally and globally, might contribute to its development.

## Features
Curretly, the app simply streams the radio station.  As of the latest version submitted to the app store (version 1.1), the app will stream over both Wi-fi and 3G.  The following is a list of features we hope to implement soon:

* Song requests (will work with our SAMAPI server - something we'll either open source, or expose the API to)
* In-app purchases for donating money to the organization
* Podcast listing and playback
* And moreâ€¦?

The primary developer of the KLIK iPhone app is Jake Wood.  You can e-mail him at <jake@klikradio.org>.
